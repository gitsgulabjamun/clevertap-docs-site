This section covers a list of frequently asked questions for CleverTap for Startups.

## 1. Can I access additional features outside of the CleverTap for Startups plan?

CleverTap for Startups provides additional features that are available as either free or paid add-ons to help you grow. After you have mastered the basics, we recommend getting our [lifecycle optimizer](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/lifecycle-optimizer?) where you can map the user lifecycle and nudge users from one engagement stage to the next. Check out all the available add-ons under the My Plan section of the platform. For more information on including or removing add-ons, refer to the [add-ons](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/billing#section-add-ons-inclusion) section. 

## 2. Are there any separate costs for sending emails and SMS? 

You can integrate several external email and SMS service providers with CleverTap. There are no additional charges from CleverTap to integrate your email or SMS service providers and start running campaigns. Find out more about our [email integrations](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/email-partners) and [SMS integrations](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/sms-partners).

## 3. How do I contact support?

CleverTap provides product documentation, video walk-throughs, educational webinars, and more. We are always here to support your growth. To report an issue or a bug, you can do so via the CleverTap platform.

## 4. Why did my payment fail?

If your card has been rejected, ensure your credit card information is up-to-date (e.g. expiration date and CVV code) and that you are entering your credit card number without dashes or spaces. If your credit card is still not processing, you may need to follow up with your bank to see if there are any issues on their end. If you are still having issues, create a support help request via the platform by providing the required details. 

## 5.  Can I make a manual payment?

Since we process payments through a third-party processor, we are unable to manually enter your credit card. Credit cards are automatically processed through CleverTap.

## 6. Can I make my payment with more than one credit card?

Our payment system is set up to upload only one credit card at a time; however, you can change your credit card information at any time.

## 7. Can I split my payment into smaller payments?

No, our payment system is set up to charge the entire invoice amount due to the credit card attached to the account.
