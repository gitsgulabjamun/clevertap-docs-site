1. **How is monthly billable MAU calculated?**  
   Billable MAU is a combination of MAU (monthly active users) and data points. A user that performs an action in a calendar month is considered MAU. The total monthly bill amount is based on whichever is highest: 

- MAU tier limit (as defined on your plan)
- Actual MAU usage
- Processed MAU: Total data points used divided by allowed data points per MAU. (A total of 2000 data points are allowed per MAU. In most cases, users perform fewer than 2,000 data points per month.)

2. **What is a data point?**  
   A data point is an event, event property, or profile property update.

3. **How are charges calculated for data uploads?**  
   If data is uploaded to amend a user profile or user activity history, the number of data points uploaded counts toward the total number of data points allocated for the month. The number of data points allocated for each calendar month is equal to the MAU tier in your pricing agreement times 2,000.
