# Overview

Marketing campaigns promote products through different types of media. Campaigns are designed with different goals in mind, including building a brand image, introducing a new product, increasing sales of a product already on the market. Defining a campaign's goal usually dictates how much marketing is needed and what media are most effective for reaching a specific segment of the population. This section describes the different messaging channels available and the ways to build campaigns in CleverTap.

# Messaging Channels

CleverTap offers seven different messaging channels enabling you to create engagement strategies to reach your users with a personalized message at the right time. 

## Mobile Channels

The mobile channels include:  
###[Push](doc:push)  
Push notifications enable you to communicate with your users when they are not in your app. These messages appear on a user's lock screen or in a top/bottom banner, depending on the platform and user configuration. 

### [In-App Messages](doc:inapp-campaigns)

In-app messages are pop-up messages that are shown to the user while they are in your app. While push notifications are viewed by the user outside the app, in-app notifications are viewed strictly inside the app. In-app notifications are great to show contextual messages, such as discount offers while the user is within the app, or to communicate with users who have turned off push notifications.

### [App Inbox](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/app-inbox)

App Inbox is a messaging channel that provides the ability to deliver rich, individually customized content to your users. Messages that are sent to App Inbox are saved on the user's device. 

### [Native Display](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/native-display)

Native Display provides the ability to embed content natively within your app screen without interrupting the app experience. It also provides the ability to change the content of your app dynamically and deliver relevant and contextual content to your users. 

### [SMS](doc:sms)

SMS notifications enable you to send short communication to your users, such as one-time passwords to authorize their use on the app or even links enabling users to download the latest version of the mobile app.

## Web Channels

**[Web Push](doc:web-push)**  
Web Push notifications are browser-based messages you can send to your desktop or mobile web users even if they are not currently visiting your website. Web Push notifications are similar to Mobile Push notifications, except the platform being targeted is the userâ€™s desktop or mobile browser.

**[Web Pop-up](doc:web-pop-ups)**  
Web pop-ups are interstitials messages displayed to the user while they are on the desktop or mobile website.

**[Web Exit Intent](doc:web-exit-intent) **  
Exit Intent messages are similar to Web Pop-ups, except they are triggered when a user navigates away from your website.

## Additional Channels

**[Email](doc:email) **

In CleverTap, you create the email content, specify the target audience, and determine when the campaign will be sent. CleverTap delivers the email messages to the third-party [email service provider](doc:email-partners) of your choosing via a simple configuration in the Dashboard.

**[Webhooks](doc:webhooks)**  
CleverTap webhooks enable developers to monitor specific user events and receive push notifications to their server when those events happen. The details of each user who qualify for the campaign are sent to the endpoint, which can be used to export data to a third-party system.

**[Facebook Audience](doc:facebook-audience)**  
Facebook Custom Audience is a great way to re-engage with your users outside of your app through ads on Facebook. The Facebook Audience module on the CleverTap dashboard makes it easy to set up Facebook Audience ads for all your users or just specific user segments. These segments can be created based on past user behavior, user properties, or a combination of past user behavior and properties. 

# Build Campaigns

## Campaigns

Within the Engage tab of the CleverTap dashboard, there is a section called Campaigns. This is where you can create new campaigns and see existing ones.

## Journeys

[Journeys](doc:journeys) is a visual campaign builder to create omnichannel messaging experiences for your users. Journeys are ideal for engaging users across the lifecycle of your app. 

Here are a few sample use cases for Journeys:

- Build User Onboarding Journeys that engage users over several days or weeks and on different channels as you educate them about your service.
- Build Promotional Journeys to entice your users to transact at different points in time.
- Long-running re-engagement campaigns to pull users back into your service if they begin to slip away.

## Clever Campaigns

[Clever Campaigns](doc:clever-campaigns) are pre-built messaging campaigns designed to help you engage and retain users at particularly crucial moments of the user lifecycle:

- Convert newly acquired users into regular users
- Encourage existing users to use your app more frequently
- Run win-back campaigns on users who have uninstalled your app
- Remind users to upgrade to the latest version of your app

# Campaign Reports

When you click on the Engage tab in the CleverTap dashboard it opens directly to the Campaign Reports table where you can see all your campaigns across every channel in one consolidated view.

Campaign Reports include the channel, delivery status, and key statistics to assess and compare performance. 

Use quick filters to isolate campaigns of interest and the email report option to deliver a CSV file to your inbox that includes all the information in the table.

# Message Labels

Message Labels allow you to tag campaigns by descriptive names or themes. Once applied, labels allow you to group your various messaging campaigns such that you can isolate their performance or identify behaviors of users that were displayed this group of messages.

For example, you can create a label called _Onboarding_ to identify all the messaging campaigns (across all channels) that are related to onboarding your new users. Or you can create a label named _Reengage_ to denote campaigns used to bring back users who have dropped off. Similarly, you can create a label called _Score Updates_ to identify only that class of notifications that were used to update users on the match.

Create labels under the _Message Settings_ menu. Apply labels to individual messaging campaigns while you create them or via the _Edit Campaign_ option in the _Campaign Report_ table.

## Segments and Message Labels

One of the more powerful uses of Labels is the combination with CleverTap Segmentation features. Each time a message is delivered to a user, CleverTap will record a Notification Sent event. As a Property of this event, we include any label that you have assigned to that messaging campaign. 

Then from our Find People, Create Segment, or any other Analytics feature, you can isolate users who have been sent a messaging campaign with a particular Label.

For example, you may want to see the 30-day retention of users who were sent Onboarding messages to judge whether these messages were having an impact. After creating a label called _Onboarding_ and associating it with all the relevant campaigns, you can create a new segment, and then filter your cohort analysis for 30-day retention to isolate the performance of only these users.
