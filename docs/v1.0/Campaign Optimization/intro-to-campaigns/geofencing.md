## Overview

CleverTap offers geofencing which is a GPS location-based service that customers can use to engage their audience by sending relevant messages to Android and iOS users. A geofence is a virtual geographic area, represented as latitude/longitude pairs combined with a radius, forming a circle in a specific position on a map. Geofences can vary in size and a geofence cluster can contain up to 100 geofences. 

Users can define geofences on the CleverTap dashboard and trigger campaigns in real-time as users enter and exit them around the world. Campaigns are delivered in real-time to users as they exit or enter geofences, or sent as followups hours or days later. As the users enter or exit geofences, CleverTap's location analytics create user data that can be used for re-targeting, and geofence-specific analytics can generate insight on activities or locations of interest.

# Create Geofences

To create geofences, perform the following steps:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, select _Settings_ > _Geofences_.

3. Select the preferred unit of measure that will be used to track location for the geofence clusters.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Click in the _Search for location_ window to select the area or business locations you want to display on the map.

12. Click **Activate**.

## Optional Features

When entering the details for the geofence cluster, you can select a DND window and if you select start and end time, you can also set a dwell time. The DND option prevents triggering an engagement for users who enter the geofence on specified days and times. Dwell time specifies the amount of time a user can remain inside the geofence before triggering an engagement.

> ðŸ“˜ Add, Edit, or Delete Geofences
> 
> Repeat the steps to add more geofences in your cluster. You can have up to 100 geofences in a cluster. In addition, you can edit or delete a geofence by clicking on the location and clicking the edit or delete icon. You can also edit or delete geofences by selecting them from the list on the left.

# Use Geofence Events

CleverTap raises two system events every time a device enters or exits a geofence that can be used to run campaigns, analytics, and segmentation:

- Geocluster Entered
- Geocluster Exited

Details about the event are provided in the events documentation section [here](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events#section-system-events).

2. Select the campaign start and end time.
3. Click ** + Create an ad-hoc segment**.
