# Overview

Regex is a feature that enables you to create a campaign that includes or excludes users who visit specific pages on your website. 

> ðŸ“˜ Regex Explained
> 
> Regex is an abbreviation for the term regular expression, which defines a search pattern for a string. The pattern can be a single character, multiple characters, or an expression with characters describing the pattern. 
> 
> Following are some Regex examples: 
> 
> - "." matches any character.
> - "ABC" matches ABC.
> - "A|B" matches A or B.

For example, if you have a travel booking site, you can create a campaign that targets users who are searching for flights between San Francisco and Los Angeles. When a user searches for flights from San Francisco (SFO) to Los Angeles (LAX) on your website, the URL follows this pattern: _<https://www.example.com/flights/SFO/LAX>_. Using the Regex below, you can identify users who visited that URL and include them in a campaign.

```text Regex
.*(SFO|LAX).*
```

# Feature Guide

When creating a campaign in CleverTap that targets web users, you can use the Regex feature to define who will receive the campaign based on pages the user did or did not visit. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/8a70f69-regex2.png",
        "regex2.png",
        900
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


If you want to include users who visited a page that matches the Regex, select the **matches regex** option. If you want to exclude those users, select the **does not match regex** option.

If there is only one page that needs to be matched or not matched for a campaign, then you can use the options **contains** or **does not contain**.
