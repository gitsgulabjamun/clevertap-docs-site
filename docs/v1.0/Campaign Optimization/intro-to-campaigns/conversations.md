## Overview

Consumers across the globe are increasingly shifting from phone calls, emails, and social media platforms to real-time messaging apps. Theyâ€™re turning to WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and other local apps to connect with family, friends, and colleagues. A similar experience is expected from brands - that they _talk_ to their users in real-time rather than waiting for responses from agents in call centers or passively communicating over emails.

## Use cases

Engaging your end users with chat based conversations has a huge impact on your business metrics.

### FAQ Types

There are 4 types of FAQs that you can create. The 'type' tag helps you to distinguish your FAQs accurately

- Greetings -  Add a greeting such as a hi, hello, good morning, and so on.
- General - Any conversation which is specific to your business need.
- Closing - Add an end to the conversation. For example, _Thank you for contacting us. Have a good day_.
- Filler - Add a filler in the conversation. For example, _Please wait while I fetch your information_. 

> ðŸ“˜ Adding a question to an FAQ
> 
> When setting up an autoresponder, it is mandatory to add at least one question to the FAQ. Our NLP model (on which the responder is built) will ensure that if similar questions are asked by your users, the autoresponder responds with the right answer

1. Navigate to _Conversations_ > _Setup_ > _Autoresponders_. The Auto Responders page displays. 
2. Click the **Edit** button on the _Quick Reply _section to add quick replies.  The Quick Reply page displays.

      ],
      "sizing": "100",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


> ðŸš§ Note
> 
> This flow assumes that the FAQ responder is configured first in the _Responders chain_ section.

## FAQ Best Practices

1. Check that the questions are detailed and clearly worded. Always prefer complete and meaningful sentences.  
   Example:

- Correct - How can I recover the password of my account? 
- Incorrect - Wrong Password

2. Add enough context to a question. Check that the answer contains all the relevant information for the user.  
   Example:

- Correct -  How can I return my order?
- Incorrect -  How to return?

3. Avoid having questions that have less than five words. However, it is okay to have short responses for closing, fillers, or greeting.  
   Example:

- Correct - Do you have COD as a payment option?
- Incorrect - COD Please 

4. Check that the FAQ sets are contextually exclusive from each other. 

5. Try to add related questions in the same FAQ to provide more context. The responder model can handle spelling errors as long as they do not affect the meaning of the sentence. Context and flow are more important than simple spelling errors or grammatical variations.  
   However, acronyms and lingos must be added in related questions separately.  
   Example:  
   FAQ - Do you have cash on delivery as a payment option?  
   Related Questions:

- Do you have COD as a payment method?
- Can I pay after the delivery is completed?

6. The responder works best for the English language. Use of any other language for adding FAQs (For example, writing Hindi using Roman/Latin script) may result in unpredictable performance. 

## Role Based Access: Agent Role

CleverTap has a system role of **Agent** which allows dashboard users to access Conversations. Apart from Agent, an admin can also access Conversations. You can have multiple agents Conversations dashboard.

> ðŸ“˜ Agent Role
> 
> Agent role is a system role along with Admin, Member, Creator and Approver. A user who is allocated an Agent role will be able to access Conversations.

To assign an _Agent_ role to a dashboard user, you can navigate to _Account_ > _Settings_ > _Users_ page. Once there, pick a user to whom you want to assign an _Agent_ role. For more details on user role management, please check out [Role Based Access Control](doc:role-based-access-control)

If you are an authenticated user (Role = Admin or Agent), you can access conversations by clicking on **Conversations** from the left navigation bar. 

> ðŸš§ What happens when more than one agent tries to chat with the same user?
> 
> It might so happen 2 or more agents click on the same conversation. In such cases, only the first agent can chat with the user and the agents who clicked later will not be able to chat.

The Conversations dashboard looks like the following:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/492b43f-Conversations_Dashboard.png",

        1097
      ],
      "caption": "Conversations dashboard"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You will see a list of conversations when you arrive on the dashboard. These conversations appear when your end-users reply to one of your campaigns.

You can click any of the messages to open the chat window. The chat window is the panel that appears on the right where you can chat with your users seamlessly.

Unlike [WhatsApp](doc:whatsapp) campaigns, where you had to use a templated messages, _Conversations_ allows you to use free form messages and attach files.

## Converting user queries into customer support tickets

> ðŸ“˜ Customer support ticketing
> 
> CleverTap provides putting a _ticket_ status to on-going chats with your end-users. This helps in categorizing and later searching based on the resolution status of your customer's queries.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2e496cf-Conversations_Dashboard_Tickets_View.png",
        "Conversations_Dashboard_Tickets_View.png",
        853
      ],
      "sizing": "100",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Ticketing in Conversations"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


There the 5 ticket statuses that can be assigned:  
**1. New:** As soon as a user replies to a campaign message, it is marked as New. This is irrespective of the previous ticket status with that user.  
**2. Active:** When an agent replies to the user.  
**3. Pending:** When the user replies back to the agent.  
**4. Resolved:** When the agent resolves the conversation.  
**5. Inactive:** These are all conversations that are past the 24-hour conversation.

> ðŸ“˜ Inactive conversations
> 
> The maximum limit for inactive conversations to appear in the inactive tab is 15.

Changing status

1. Agent can move the status from one to the other
2. Tickets auto change status based on the below criteria

| Flow                                     | Status   | Location                         |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------- |
| When user messages you for the 1st time  | New      | All conversations                |
| When your agent replies back to the user | Active   | My conversations (for the agent) |
| When user replies back to the agent      | Pending  | My conversations (for the agent) |
| When agent resolves the conversation     | Resolved | All conversation                 |
| When 24 hour window expires              | Inactive | Inactive conversations           |

The _ticket status_ is similar to a system profile property and hence, it is also queryable on the dashboard.

## **Updating status manually**

Assigning a ticket to a _Conversation_ is fairly simple. If you click on a conversation and close it, a pop-up appears asking you to assign a ticket before closing it. You can update the ticket status here.
