You can view comprehensive reports for all campaigns you send out of CleverTap. You can use these reports to analyze campaign performance, compare performance across campaigns, and understand engagement trends.

Campaign reports allow monitoring campaign performance at a glance. You can mail either a summary report of all campaigns sent out in a particular date range or even split it by day. This report includes metrics, such as campaign deliveries, engagements, conversions, and errors. To optimize dashboard performance, the data in the report is cached and you could receive data that has been generated up to 4 hours earlier. Also, itâ€™s possible that the report is sent to you within 6 hours depending on the other activities happening at the time of requesting the report.

# Reports API

You can use the [Get Campaign Report API](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/get-campaign-report-api) to programmatically generate campaign reports for your consumption.

# Campaign Report Data

For example, the first column Campaign ID will be part of each report, irrespective of the data group. However, the campaign name will appear as a column in your report, only if you select 'Campaign overview' while requesting the report.
