## Overview

This section covers various types of mobile channels including push notifications, in-app messages, and SMS.

## [Push Notifications](doc:push)

Push notifications provide the ability to communicate with your users when they are not in your app. These messages display on a user's lock screen or in a top/bottom banner depending on platform and user configuration.

## [In-App Messages](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/inapp-campaigns)

In-app messages are pop-up messages shown to the user while they are in your app. While push notifications are viewed by the user outside the app, in-app notifications are viewed strictly inside the app. In-app notifications are great to show contextual messages, such as discount offers while the user is within the app, or to communicate with users who have turned off push notifications.

## [App Inbox](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/app-inbox)

App Inbox is a messaging channel that provides the ability to deliver rich, individually customized content to your users. Messages that are sent to App Inbox are saved on the user's device. 

## [Native Display](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/native-display)

Native Display provides the ability to embed content natively within your app screen without interrupting the app experience. It also provides the ability to change the content of your app dynamically and deliver relevant and contextual content to your users. 

## [SMS](doc:sms)

SMS notifications provide the ability to send brief communication to your users, such as one-time passwords to authorize their use on your app, or even links enabling users to download the latest version of your mobile app.
