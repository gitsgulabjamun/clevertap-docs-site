# Create Organization

After setting the password, create your organization. An organization on CleverTap is the umbrella under which you may have multiple business units and their apps running. 

For example, an e-commerce organization may have a separate organization for Shoes and Apparels. Enter the required information. 

1. Enter the organization Name
2. Check that the number of employees in your organization is correct. This field is not editable and the value is already set during the sign up procedure. 
3. Check the Monthly Active Users (MAU). It is calculated as total number of users who have performed one or more events during the month. This metric helps track whether users are opening the mobile application at least once a month. This field is not editable and the value is already set during the sign up procedure. 
4. Select the Industry.

Your Organization is now created within CleverTap. You can add the project at this stage. There can be multiple projects for each organization. For example, an OTT app can have separate projects for media streaming and music streaming.
