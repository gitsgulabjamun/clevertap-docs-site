You can use Single Sign-On (SSO) to access your CleverTap dashboard. You must be on a CleverTap corporate pack and use an identity provider or a custom SAML implementation in order to use SSO with CleverTap

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> You need to be an account admin to setup SSO

# Setting up SSO configuration on CleverTap

![](https://files.readme.io/5b022c4-image4.png "image4.png")

## Accessing Setup page

As an admin user, login to the CleverTap dashboard  
Navigate to Settings > SSO  
You will be directed to the SSO setup page

## Configure SAML

1. Copy the entity id and Assertion Consumer service URL from the CleverTap and paste it in the IdP in Audience URI and Single sign on URL respectively as shown below

![](https://files.readme.io/89d232f-image8.png "image8.png")

2. Validate the Signature hash algorithm and binding to ensure they are the same in the Idp.  
   Signature Hash Algorithm: SHA-256  
   Binding: HTTP POST

3. Provide XML metadata to CleverTap. You can copy the XML metadata and paste it or upload the file.  
   CleverTap supports dynamic configuration which requires you to enter the IdP Metadata  
   This IdP Metadata is provided by your identity provider and will look similar to the screenshot shown below (in XML format)

![](https://files.readme.io/02c38b1-image11.png "image11.png")

This IdP Metadata is provided by your identity provider and will look similar to the screenshot shown below (in XML format)

![](https://files.readme.io/bd84fde-image2.png "image2.png")

4. Set your unique domain url  
   A CleverTap domain, unique to your CleverTap application needs to be provided so that it can be used to authenticate your CleverTap account  
   Note: Please use a name which is easy to remember as this will be used by your team to login to the CleverTap account

![](https://files.readme.io/d6b7fc3-image12.png "image12.png")

This completes your basic setup of SAML SSO. You can test the SSO setup from the CleverTap dashboard to be sure if the setup is done correctly

## Additional Settings

### Login with SSO only

Under the Settings->SSO  you can find the setting "Require all users to login using SSO"

![](https://files.readme.io/849cfd8-image9.png "image9.png")

If you select this option, your team members will NOT be able to login to CleverTap directly. They will be forced to login via the SSO option only.

> ðŸš§ Use this option if your entire team has your domain email id and are setup on your IdP  
> If you have outsourced teams who do not have an email address in your domain, do not select this option as they will not be able to login to CleverTap  
> If you select this option, you will not be able to create a user from the CleverTap dashboard or assign a role to the user, this will have to managed via the Identity Provider.

### Bind existing users

- If you already have a user setup on CleverTap and want to migrate them to SSO along with their CleverTap roles and account access, select this option
- This will give you the option to download the users list in the following  
  Copy these user settings and paste them in the custom attributes in your IdP(More on how to setup Custom attributes is given below)
- This will ensure that all users who are currently on CleverTapâ€™s authentication and authorization, will be seamlessly migrated to the IdPs authentication and authorization.

> ðŸ“˜ IdP Setup
> 
> Below, you will be able to see how to setup access for the following IdPs
> 
> 1. Okta
> 2. OneLogin
> 3. Gsuite
> 
> Other IdPs follow similar instructions.

# Identity Provider setup

Identity Provider (IdP) is the authority that verifies and asserts a user's identity and access to a requested resource (the "Service Provider")  
Some examples of IdPs are Okta and GSuite

## Okta Setup

### Creating an Application

All IdPs allow you to create an app which you want to access using SSO  
Start the setup by creating a CleverTap app in your IdP setup  
Example provided below is for setting up an app with Okta  
Select Platform -> Web and Sign on method -> SAML 2.0

![](https://files.readme.io/2c851bc-image5.png "image5.png")

![](https://files.readme.io/a1f27ba-image10.png "image10.png")

### Validate settings

Also validate the Signature hash algorithm and binding to ensure they are the same in the Idp.  
Signature Hash Algorithm: SHA-256  
Binding: HTTP POST

![](https://files.readme.io/a77e184-Screenshot_2020-03-24_at_1.12.46_PM.png "Screenshot 2020-03-24 at 1.12.46 PM.png")

### Attributes

You will have to add some attributes for SSO to work .  
Attributes for name and email are compulsory in the format given in the screenshot.  
You will need to add an attribute for each accountid you have in CleverTap .  
This is so that you can select for each account what role you want to give the users access to at a granular level .  
Navigate to Applications->Select your application-> General ->Configure SAML  
The following attributes are Mandatory

![](https://files.readme.io/5932ccc-Screenshot_2020-03-12_at_3.53.39_PM.png "Screenshot 2020-03-12 at 3.53.39 PM.png")

Now if you have 2 Accounts on Clevertap , you will need to add the 2 AcccountId's in the following way .  
You can name them as appuser.\[Identifier} , here we have used appuser.MainAccRole and appuser.MaiAccRole1 as examples  
This will tell CleverTap which account a user should have access to.  
Click on Next and Finish to complete the process

![](https://files.readme.io/8eea100-Screenshot_2020-03-12_at_3.55.31_PM.png "Screenshot 2020-03-12 at 3.55.31 PM.png")

Now we need to define what Role should the user have for each account  
Navigate to Directory -> Profile Editor -> Hover on you app and select Profile .  
Here you will need to add and define what you want to call these Attributes and what roles can these attributes get .  
Click on Add attribute 

- You can name the Variable as "Your Account Name" to ensure that when assigning a name you can understand what account you are assigning the user too .
- ensure you add the Name in Variable as you did earlier for AccountID[MainAccRole and MainAccRole1 from our example].
- Click the check box for enumerated list and add all combinations of roles that you can possibly want to assign your user (you can get these combination from SSO Settings in the CleverTap Dashboard as a CSV and just copy paste 
- **It is important that you always add a attribute member "NoAccess" and provide with an empty "{}" , so that you can select this value when you do not want to give user access to this account .**
- Click Save 

![](https://files.readme.io/5e4a74f-Screenshot_2020-07-21_at_7.59.17_PM.png "Screenshot 2020-07-21 at 7.59.17 PM.png")

Ensure that the Attributes are mapped correctly by going to , this will ensure the correct values are passed to CleverTap  
Directory->Profile Editor -> Click on Profile(For you App) -> Mappings 

![](https://files.readme.io/ea10dd0-Screenshot_2020-07-21_at_8.03.41_PM.png "Screenshot 2020-07-21 at 8.03.41 PM.png")

Now you need to assign users to your Application.  
Navigate to Applications->"Select your application" -> Assignments  
Select the User and what role you want to give to the user for each account, if you do not want to give user access to the account select "NoAccess" and Save.

3. Navigate to Users and Click on User you want to give Access to.  
   You will need to navigate to Custom Attributes and the define the role for each account for this user .
4. Take the roleMap JSON that is available in the CSV download(Dashboard->Settings->SSO) for the user-account combination and paste it in respective Attributes for each account.
5. If you do not want to give user access to the account define an empty JSON { } which will indicate that the user has No Access for this Account.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> If you do want to give user access to an account , you need to define an empty JSON which just empty curly braces -> { }.
