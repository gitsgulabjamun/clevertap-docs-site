## What is IP Restriction

CleverTap allows you to restrict the dashboard usage to specific IPs

Once the capability is enabled, you will be able to access CleverTap Account's dashboard only from the specified IPs

Control login access at the account level by specifying a range of allowed IP addresses for the account. When you define IP address restrictions for an account, a login from any other IP address is denied.

## How does IP Restriction work

If enabled, all users of the account will be able to access the CleverTap dashboard only from the whitelisted IPs  
For all other IPs, the user will not be able to login

## How to enable IP Restriction

The capability is available for all Enterprise customers  
To enable IP restriction, please raise a ticket from the CleverTap dashboard.
