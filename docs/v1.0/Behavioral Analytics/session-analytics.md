## Overview

_Session Analytics_ can be used to track the events that users perform within a session. Analyzing session length is a great way to measure engagement for certain apps, such as video or music streaming, news, and so on.

A session is a period of continuous activity by the user. A user can perform as many events as required over a period of time; however, we consider a session timeout after 20 minutes of user inactivity. A new session is created after this session timeout. Sessions can be tracked on the Web as well as mobile apps.

> Sessions cannot be tracked for events pushed through API calls.

# Activate Sessions

You can start tracking user sessions after activating sessions from the CleverTap dashboard. The ability to track sessions is available in _Settings_ > _Session Analytics_.

After you activate session tracking, you have the following:

- The _Session Concluded_ event is raised to mark the end of every session.
- A new system property called _CT Session ID_ is available for every event.
- A _Session Board_ is available within the _Boards_ section.

> ðŸš§ List of Events that Are Not Considered
> 
> The following events are not considered for a session:
> 
> - App Installed
> - App Uninstalled
> - Notification Sent
> - Notification Clicked
> - UTM Visited
> - Identity Set
> - Identity Reset
> - Identity Error

# CT Session ID

A system property called _CT Session ID_ is available for each event. This _CT Session ID_ also appears on the userâ€™s profile page.

# Session Concluded Event

A system event called _Session Concluded_ marks the end of a session. This event is raised after 20 minutes of inactivity.

The _Session Concluded_ event contains the following event properties:

- Session Length: It is the time period from the first event up to the last event measured in seconds. 
- Session ID: It is a unique ID to identify the session. 

> ðŸš§ Availability Note
> 
> This event is not available for engagement in the live user segments.

> ðŸ“˜ Timestamp for a Session Concluded
> 
> The timestamp for the _Session Concluded_ event is the same as the most recent event.
> 
> For example, _Event 1_ was performed at 11:00 AM and _Event 2_ was performed at 11:10 AM. There is a period of inactivity after this event. After waiting for 20 minutes, a _Session Concluded_ event is raised at 11.30 AM, however, the timestamp for the _Session Concluded_ event is marked as 11:10 AM to identify the exact time of the last activity.

# Session Dashboard

This board is created automatically after you turn on session tracking. To view the session dashboard, perform the following:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, click **Boards**. 
2. Check for a board called _Session_ and open it.

The session dashboard displays an overview of the app sessions with the following information:

- Session length distribution: The distribution of session length (in seconds).
- Sum of session lengths per day: The total session length across all users per day in the last 30 days.
- Number of sessions: The number of sessions in a day that occurred over the past 30 days.
