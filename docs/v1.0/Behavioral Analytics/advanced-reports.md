In CleverTap, we have custom analytics to help you answer specific questions about your app usage and business metrics.

# Funnels

[Funnels](doc:funnels) are a way of grouping users who take a specific event in your app and comparing how many of those users go on to take a second event in your app in a specified period of time. For example, you might construct a funnel analyzing the users in your app who added an item to cart and then went on to complete the cart checkout process.

# Cohorts

[Cohorts](doc:cohorts) are a way of grouping users who are similar, based on what they have done, and tracking their behavior over time. Cohorts let you isolate a group of users who have performed a certain event and determine how long it takes for them to come back and perform a second event.

# Trends

[Trends](doc:trends) analysis is the process of comparing events over time to identify patterns. For example, identifying and analyzing event patterns in your app can help you assess how well you are doing in encouraging specific user behavior over time.

You can use the Trends View to see trend analysis on specific events in your application. You can also filter by specific properties of those events, user attributes, or device models.

# Pivots

[Pivots](doc:pivots) summarize your data and helps you slice it and dice it with the help of tables and other data visualizations. A Pivot analysis is especially useful when you are dealing with a large volume of data as it allows you to create incisive summaries and view custom reports to gleam insights.
