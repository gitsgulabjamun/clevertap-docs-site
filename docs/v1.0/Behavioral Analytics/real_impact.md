## Overview

_Real Impact_ is a reporting dashboard that shows how and by what extent users respond to your CleverTap marketing campaignsâ€”everything from the revenue generated to churn. With _Real Impact_, you can move beyond vanity metrics and optimize your campaigns based on which campaigns are driving business results.

> ðŸš§ System Control Group Requirement and Performance
> 
> To view _Real Impact_ performance metrics, you need to enable a system control group for your account; this system control group is an account-level categorization of profiles that will never receive any of your campaigns. For more information, refer to [Control Groups](doc:control-groups).
> 
> It might take some time for target groups to show a marked improvement in performance over a system control group. For instance, if you have created a system control group 5 to 10 days ago, your performance numbers might not be as distinctive. 
> 
> It is recommended to wait for a few weeks after creating a system control group to visualize accurate figures in the _Real Impact_ dashboard.

_Real Impact_ helps you measure the impact of your campaigns:

- Visualize the boost in performance in your target segments as compared to users who have not received any campaigns.
- Estimate what percentage of users have churned in the target group by contrasting it with control groups.
- Calculate the segment-wise impact of essential business metrics and know which segments have been performing better compared to others.
- Visualize user movement from one RFM segment to another.

## How is Real Impact Calculated

As mentioned above in order to calculate _Real Impact_, we use system control groups and the calculation is done on the basis of comparison of the performance of target group vs. system control groups.

> ðŸ“˜ Formula
> 
> The formula consists of:
> 
> - TG = Target group metric value
> - SCG = System control group metric value
> 
> Boost or drop % = (TG-SCG) / SCG \* 100

## Performance Metrics

You can check performance metrics for any segment at any date range. CleverTap offers the capability to measure the following performance metrics out of the box:

## RFM Score

RFM scores denote the value of your app/website's users. The value of the user is measured across three dimensions including, recency, frequency, and monetary, then the user is automatically assigned a score.

> ðŸ“˜ How RFM Score is Calculated
> 
> CleverTap uses a unique method to calculate RFM scores. Recency, frequency, and monetary values are calculated for all users. Users are divided into five different sections according to their percentiles. Therefore, the bottom 20% will be in the first percentile and get a score of 1. The next 20% get a score of 2 and so on up to a score of 5. 
> 
> The scores are calculated for all the three dimensions including, recency (R), frequency (F), and monetary (M). Finally, the RFM score is also calculated by taking into considerations the weights of the individual dimensions.
> 
> RFM Score = 4xR + 2xF + M
