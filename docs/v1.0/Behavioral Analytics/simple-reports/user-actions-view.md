# User Actions View

User actions or events are activities that a user does in your mobile app or website, such as viewing a product or making a purchase. You’ll have to integrate the CleverTap SDK to record events from your app or website. To record historical events or offline events, you can use the CleverTap Server API.

Using the Dashboard → Analyze → User Actions View, you can filter and segment (i.e. group) users based on the events they have taken in your application.

You accomplish this by:

Selecting the event to segment by – you can also filter that event by the properties recorded for that event.  
Optionally applying filters based on user attributes, including specific geographic, demographic data, or device information.  
Once constructed, the Dashboard provides deep insights into the user group defined by your event query, including geographic, demographic and device information.

You can then save this event query and use it later to send targeted messages to those users.
