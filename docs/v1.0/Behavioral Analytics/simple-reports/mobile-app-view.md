To get to this view, navigate to _Boards_ > _Mobile App_.

This view shows:

- _Daily Active Users_, _Weekly Active Users_, and _Monthly Active Users_ represent users who have launched your application at least once the respective _Daily_, _Weekly_ and _Monthly_ time period.
- _Daily Paying Users_, _Weekly Paying Users_, and _Monthly Paying Users_ represent users for whom you have raised the _Charged_ event (or users qualifying as per the conversion event) at least once during the relevant time period.

This view presents detailed metrics on:

- 1, 3, and 7-day _Retention_, _Engagement_ and _Conversion_ percentages, reflecting the percentage of new users who return to your application, meaningfully engage with your application, and convert into paying (or another conversion metric you choose) users, respectively, during the first 1, 3 and 7 days after first use.
- _Daily Revenue_ generated.
- _Daily Paying Users_/_Daily Active Users (DPU/DAU(%)_) and _Daily Paying Users_/_Monthly Active Users (DPU/MAU(%)_) which measure the proportion of your active users who are making payments in your application (i.e., how good you are at converting users into paying users).
- _Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (ARPDAU)_ which gives a sense of revenue earned on a daily basis per user from your application.
- _Average Revenue Per Daily Paying User (ARPDPU)_ which gives a sense of average daily revenue from a paying user in your application.
- _Daily Active Users_/_Monthly Active Users(DAU/MAU(%)_), also known as _Sticky Quotient_, which represents the percentage of your monthly active users who visit your application daily (i.e., how many of your active users are very active users).
