# Overview

CleverTap provides a set of default dashboards, such as the [Today View](doc:today-view) which you can use to analyze user activity in your application. _Custom Dashboards_ is a feature in CleverTap that provides the capability to create and customize your own board. 

Each custom dashboard you create is composed of cards which are widgets that you can pin to the board to track metrics you are most interested in. You can pin cards that track [events](doc:events), [funnels](doc:funnels), [segments](doc:segments), [trends](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/trends), and [cohorts](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/cohorts).

For example, if you want to create a custom dashboard to analyze _App Launch_ events over the past 30 days, you can add a line graph card to view the number of _App Launch_ events and a bar graph to view the distribution between App Launched and Charged.

## Dashboard Shareability

CleverTap provides restricted dashboard access so that the owner of a dashboard can control the members who can view and contribute to the insights captured on the dashboard. The dashboard owner can add and remove members from the access list and can control access levels. 

### Sharing Custom Dashboards

To share a dashboard, perform the following steps:

1. Refer to the steps in [Build Your First Custom Dashboard](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/custom-dashboards#build-your-first-custom-dashboard) and create a dashboard. Once a dashboard is created, a _Share_ icon displays in the list of options; however, the icon is only visible to the board's creator.
