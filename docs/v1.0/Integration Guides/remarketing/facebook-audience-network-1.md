# Overview

The benefit of integrating your Facebook Ads account with CleverTap is getting per-campaign, per-user cost data and the average revenue for users acquired via that campaign. This helps you understand the cost of a campaign versus the revenue earned with it.

To integrate your Facebook Ads account, perform the following steps:

# Step 1: Get Your Facebook Ads Account ID

- Log in to your [Facebook Ads account](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/home/).
- Navigate to _Settings_, and copy the _Account ID_ visible under _Account Information_.

# Step 2: CleverTap Dashboard Steps

- Log into your CleverTap Dashboard, and navigate to _Settings_ > _Channel_ > _Remarketing_. 

> üìò Users with Multiple CleverTap Accounts
> 
> If you have multiple CleverTap accounts, make sure that you are using the correct one.
