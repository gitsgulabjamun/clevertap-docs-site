After you select the segment of users you want to target, you can either add the selected segment to an existing Audience list from your Google AdWords account or you can create a new one.  

Once you create this campaign in CleverTap, Google will update the audience list within 48 hours. You can then add these audience lists to your ad groups in AdWords and start serving them ads. 

# Additional Notes about Adwords Remarketing

- Since it takes up to 48 hours for an Audience list to be populated with members, you will most likely see an "In Progress" status within the AdWords UI when you update an audience list.
- Email addresses must be associated with a Google account.
- Only @gmail.com addresses can be used for targeting in Gmail.
- For privacy purposes, the user list size will show as zero until the list has at least 1,000 members. After that, the size will be rounded to the two most significant digits.
- Google matches the email/phone according to the process [mentioned here](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/7474263). This means the number of people uploaded may be less than the number of people actually shown on your AdWords account.
