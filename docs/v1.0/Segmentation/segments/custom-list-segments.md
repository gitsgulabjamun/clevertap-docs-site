# Introduction

Custom List Segments are custom segments that you can create based on your requirements and analytics. These can be users with the required interests, demographics, and so on. You can use these segments to re-engage your users without having to apply the same conditions or filters again. 

## Examples

A custom list segment can be handy in many scenarios. Typical use cases can be any of the following and more:

- A retail business running SMS campaigns:  
  As a retail business, you may be generating user lists at your point of sale across different cities. You can upload city-based segments and run personalized campaigns to re-engage these users. 

- Engagement integrated with your segmentation engine:  
  You may have a segmentation engine or a data science engine that has created a user set to engage with a specific message. In this case, you can use custom list segments to seamlessly create segments from your custom lists and schedule engagement for them. 

- Real-time sync for engagement with your in-house segments:  
  For example, an app streaming a football match can have millions of users. However, let us assume that the target audience is 10,000 users. The next match is even more interesting and you are expecting a surge in the number of users. You have a list of 15,000 users handy that you can use to run the campaign. You create a segment on this list and run a campaign immediately.  

# Create a custom list segment

You can create a custom list segment by uploading user lists via the dashboard or an API. 

## File Format

The list of the users for your segment must follow a specific format. You can upload the profiles with identity type as GUID or CleverTap ID (g) or the identity (i). 

The format of the CSV file is as follows:

| Type | Identity                         |
| :--- | :------------------------------- |
| g    | a1e2723cba7c4518bea8ef95b036ac83 |
| i    | identity                         |

The type and identity columns are mandatory for uploading a custom list segment.  

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> You can only qualify the user profiles that are already available in CleverTap.
