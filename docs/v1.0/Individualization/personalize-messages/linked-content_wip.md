Linked content gives you the ability to personalize your messages with rich and contextual data that is available outside of the CleverTap platform. Linked content helps you to send messages with send-time personalization. 

For example, you deliver food across different geographies and you want to personalize offers to each user based on the weather of their location. The location can come from CleverTap personalization and the weather information can come from a third party API that provides the current weather. If you want to add more information, you can opt for any source such as third-party tools and in-house software to include in your message.

In a user scenario, you could have three users, one in New York where it is snowing, one in San Francisco where it is cloudy, and one in Miami where it is sunny. You can add conditions in your messages to deliver messages according to the weather and location where the message will be something, such as:

- New York user - Since this user is probably staying in, you send an offer for ordering piping hot food. 
- San Francisco user - Since it is the weekend, this user may go out in the evening, so you send an offer for a dinner reservation at a nearby restaurant. 
- Miami user - Since it is always sunny, you send an offer for a nearby barbecue restaurant. 

This send-time personalization can help you to cater to end-user requirements at send time and bump your open rates significantly.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> You can create _Linked Content_ using _Liquid Tags._ For more information, refer to [Liquid Tags](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/liquid-tags) before you begin.

You can use _Linked Content_ with the following engagement channels:

- Email
- Mobile Push
- SMS
- Webhooks

# Create and Edit API Names

You can get the data for send-time personalization from different APIs. API names are nicknames that you can assign to the provider APIs. You can call these anywhere in your message, so that you do not have to mention the entire API name. For example, you can shorten `http://api.example.com/weather-management/city-weather`  to just `Weather`.

The following shows you how to create API names:

1. Select _Settings_ > _Setup_ > _Linked Content_. The _Linked Content_ page displays.
2. Click the **+ Linked Content **button to call a new API. To edit the linked content, click the ellipsis menu, then click the edit icon. 
3. Enter a name for the API.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Enter all the relevant details, such as access key and query parameters.

> ðŸ“˜ Tip
> 
> The API parameters are available with the API provider. Refer to their website or contact their support for API details.

5. Click the **Test Linked Content** link. 
6. Enter the required details to test the API. If the input is correct, you will see a success message. The test response appears in the JSON response box. The following is an example response:

8. Click the **Test and save changes** button to save all the API changes. 

# Map APIs

The APIs must be mapped to the campaign from the _What_ section. After the APIs are mapped, you can use them in the email body using [liquid tags](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/liquid-tags). The sample scenario below shows how to create an email campaign using liquid tags and linked content.

1. Create an [email campaign](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/email#section-email-campaign-creation-steps).  
2. Select the _New email with rich media_ template. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Linked content is currently available for the rich media template.

3. From the [What](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/email#section-step-4-define-the-what) section, click the **Map to campaign** link. The _Map Linked Content_ window displays.

        1398
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Select your APIs from the list.

{
  "images": [
    {

        658
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


5. Map the API parameters to the user and event properties, or add custom parameters. Here, we have mapped the query parameter that fetches location with the profile property _Location_. This means is that each of the users is sent an offer based on their location. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/1ecf10d-Linked_Content_map_api_parameters.png",
        "Linked_Content_map_api_parameters.png",
        666
      ],
      "sizing": "smart",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


6. Save the mapping. 

We are now ready to start writing Linked Content. 

# Write Linked Content

After you have created and saved the APIs, create the linked content for your messages. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with [Liquid Tags](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/liquid-tags) before you start writing Linked Content. 

The syntax for writing linked content is `Linked.APIName.label`. 

## Use Labels

You can write linked content with labels. There are two types of labels that you can use in your linked content. 

- Custom Labels - These are labels you can create yourself. For example, password or authorization key.
- System Labels - These are default labels you can use to analyze API responses. 

### Custom Labels

The API response will provide you with a set of object labels. However, if you want additional personalization, you can create custom labels during the creation and editing of [APIs](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/linked-content#section-create-edit-namespaces). These will not be part of the API response.  

### System Labels

These are CleverTap labels that are available by default. You can use them to gauge the health of your API and check whether the responses are received correctly or not. 

| System Labels    | Description                                                                                               |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| raw              | This is a raw API response.                                                                               |
| JSON             | This is the raw response parsed as JSON.                                                                  |
| http_status_code | This is the HTTP status code to identify errors, such as, 404 (not found), 401 (unauthorized), and so on. |
| headers          | These are response headers.                                                                               |

## Arrays in API

The response from an API may have arrays with nested JSON. 

```json Example Response
"restaurants_info": [
    { 
        "id": "16769241",
        "name": "Junior's Restaurant",
        "user_rating": {
            "aggregate_rating": "4.7",
            "rating_text": "Excellent",
            "votes": "538"
     }      
    },
  
    {
        "id": "16763460",
        "name": "Cookshop",
        "user_rating": {
           "aggregate_rating": "4.6",
           "rating_text": "Excellent",
           "votes": "252"
        }
    }
]
```

You can create conditions based on this array. For example, the response above has an array called `restaurants`. This array contains items under it such as id, name, rating. Notice the object `user_rating`. It is a nested object that contains an aggregate rating of the restaurant, rating text from an actual user, number of votes, and so on. You can use the array in the following manner:

```liquid Array list
{% for restaurant in Linked.RestaurantAPI.restaurants_info limit:5%} 
{{restaurant.name}}  {{restaurant.user_rating.rating_text}}
{% endfor %}
```

The output will be something similar to the following text:

```text Output - Array list
Marta has a rating  Excellent
PN Wood Fired Pizza  Excellent
PQR Very Good
&pizza   Good
Leonelli Focacceria e Pasticceria Good
```

## Create Message 

In our previous user scenario, you have three users, one in New York where it is snowing, one in San Francisco where it is cloudy, and one in Miami where it is sunny. You can add conditions in your messages to deliver messages according to the weather and zip code. So, you can plan the following message:

- New York user - Since this user is probably staying in, you send an offer for ordering piping hot food. 
- San Francisco user - Since it is the weekend, this user may go out in the evening, so you send an offer for a dinner reservation at a nearby restaurant. 
- Miami user - Since it is always sunny, you send an offer for a nearby barbecue restaurant. 

The following is how a written personalized linked content for your users may look like:

```liquid
Hi {{ Profile.name | default:"there!" }},

{% if Linked.cityBasedWeather.temp > 30 %}
It is a bright sunny day in {{ Profile.location | default:"your city" }}. How about a barbeque today?


{% elsif Linked.cityBasedWeather.temp < 10 %}
It is indeed cold today in {{ Profile.location | default:"your city" }}!! Time for some hot pizza!
{% else %}
It has  been a while in {{ Profile.location | default:"your city" }}. Order something exotic!
{% endif %}
```

If you want to add a list of the top 5 restaurants in this message, you can add the following in the main message:

```liquid
{% for restaurant in Linked.RestaurantAPI.restaurants_info limit:5%} 
{{restaurant.name}}  {{restaurant.user_rating.rating_text}}
{% endfor %}
```

The final message before you send out the email may look like the following:

```liquid
Hi {{ Profile.name | default:"there!" }},

{% if Linked.cityBasedWeather.temp > 30 %}
It is a bright sunny day in {{ Profile.location | default:"your city" }}. How about a barbeque today?

Use the coupon code (BARBQ).
These are the top 5 restaurants near you:
{% for restaurant in Linked.RestaurantAPI.restaurants_info limit:5%} 
{{restaurant.name}}  {{restaurant.user_rating.rating_text}}
{% endfor %}


{% elsif Linked.cityBasedWeather.temp < 10 %}
It is indeed cold today in {{ Profile.location | default:"your city" }}!! 
Time for some hot pizza!
                                         
Use the coupon code (PIZZA). These are the top 5 restaurants near you:
{% for restaurant in Linked.RestaurantAPI.restaurants_info limit:5%} 
{{restaurant.name}}  {{restaurant.user_rating.rating_text}}
{% endfor %}
                                          
{% else %}
                                          
It has  been a while in {{ Profile.location | default:"your city" }}. 
Order something exotic!
                                          
Use the coupon code (EXOTIC).These are the top 5 restaurants near you:           {% for restaurant in Linked.RestaurantAPI.restaurants_info limit:5%} 
{{restaurant.name}}  {{restaurant.user_rating.rating_text}}
{% endfor %}
                                          
{% endif %}
```
