CleverTap doesn’t sample data when collecting it from your apps, websites or when you send it via the API. All the data you send, is always collected. However, to improve your experience in the dashboard, while querying large data sets, CleverTap will sample the output to ensure that you get the results faster.

If you want to see an upsampled result, you can always switch the query mode, from “Fast” to “Accurate”. When switched to “Accurate” CleverTap will load the entire result as opposed to sampling data.

> 🚧 Sampling in CleverTap has been optimized for accuracy, however, like with all sampled data you might see a 2% difference between sampled and upsampled data.
