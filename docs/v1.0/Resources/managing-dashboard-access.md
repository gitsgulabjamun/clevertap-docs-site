# Step 2: Setting User Roles

User roles determine the access level and permissions of a CleverTap Dashboard user for a particular account. The same user could have a different role for each of the CleverTap accounts they have access to.

## Admin Role

An Admin user has full and unlimited access to the account. 

**Admin User Permissions**

- Invite new users with Admin, Creator or Member role.
- Revoke access of an existing user.
- Create campaigns.
- Stop and archive campaigns.
- Approve or reject campaigns created by users in the Creator role.
- View analytics.
- Download user profiles.
- Download reports.
- Add and update billing details.

## Approver Role

An Approver user has all the permissions of a Creator user. The Approver role also has the ability to approve or reject campaigns created by users in the Creator role.

> ðŸš§ Not Enabled by Default
> 
> The Approver role is not enabled by default. Please contact your CleverTap sales representative, or email CleverTap support ([support@clevertap.com](mailto:support@clevertap.com)) to enable it in your account.

**Approver User Permissions**

- Create and send campaigns.
- Approve or reject campaigns created by users in the Creator role.

## Creator Role

A Creator user has access to create, edit, schedule, and stop notification campaigns.

If you have not enabled the Creator Approver feature, then the Creator can send the campaign directly.

## Member Role

A Member user has access to view analytics and reports in the account.
