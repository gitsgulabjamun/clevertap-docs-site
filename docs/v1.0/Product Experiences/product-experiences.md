## Overview

With _Product Experiences_, you can change the behavior and appearance of your app remotely without an update. This helps you to deliver in-app personalization experience to your app users and test their response. You can use _product config_ to modify app behavior and feature flags to add or remove features from your app without performing an app store deployment.

You can remotely configure your app with product config. The configuration can be anything, including the look and feel of the app, and the workflow for users.

For example, you want to want to enable dark mode on your app; however, you want the following additional options:

- You want to test it first on iPhone users who live in New York. 
- You must also be capable of disabling the feature if it needs more work. 

You can create a product config for this improvement and test the response to your app.  Before using product config, you must complete the necessary setup. 

# Set up

To run a product config or a feature flag, you must create keys and segments for your app. 

## Create Keys

These are the keys that you have defined in your app code. You can map these keys from the CleverTap dashboard and control the configuration of your app. 

To create keys:

1. Navigate to _Product Experiences_ >  _Setup_ > _Keys_
2. Click **+Key **to create a new key. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> The name of the key defined here must match the name of the key defined in the app. This name cannot be changed later. You can add up to 500 keys.

3. Add the _Key_ definition. 

You can now activate or deactivate the dark mode based on the keys. The default value that the app is expecting for this key is `3`.  These values are set in your app. Assume the key-value 3 means activate the feature, 4 means deactivate the feature.

    }
  ]
}
[/block]


4. Click **Save**. The `dark_mode` key is now listed on the _Manage Keys_ page. 

### Edit/Archive Keys

To edit/archive keys:

1. Navigate to _Product Experiences_ >  _Setup_ > _Keys_. The _Keys_ page displays. 
2. Click the ellipsis menu to edit or archive a key. Only the default value and description can be edited after saving a key.

You can view all the archived keys by selecting the _Archived Keys_ box at the bottom of the key's list.  If a key is used in a product config or feature flag then it cannot be archived. 

## Create Segments

The segments are the target users who will receive app changes. 

To define the segments:

1. Navigate to _Product Experiences_ >  _Setup_ > _Segments_
2. Click **+Segment** to create a new segment.
3. Name the segment.
4. Create a segment by users who performed and/or did not perform an event.  You can also create segments for user properties such a demographics, geography, and so on. For our example, create a segment of iPhone users living in New York. 
5. Save the segment.

# Product Config

## Create Product Config

You can have multiple members of your team create product config with multiple keys and segments. You can then group these keys.

2. Click the **+Product Config **button to create a new product config. The create a _Product Config_ page displays. 
3. Enter the name and description for your product config. For our example, name the product config as _dark mode_. 
4. Select the _Segments_ and _Keys_ for your product config group. The _keys_ are the keys that you have assigned in your app for each element or feature and the _segments_ are the group of users who will receive this feature. 

For example, select the "iPhone users in New York"  and "iPhone users in Miami" as _Segments_ and "Dark_Key" as the _Product Config Key_. For more information on creating keys, refer to [Keys](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/product-experiences#section-create-keys).

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> A key can only be used in one product config.

# Feature Flags

You can have canary releases using feature flags. You can remotely turn on or turn off features on your app. 

For example, you want to want to enable an automatic playlist of recommended videos on your app. This is a really great feature but it freezes the app screen for some versions of iOS. You want the following options:

- You must be able to target iPhone users.  
- You want to test it on 20% of New York users and 30 % of Miami users before you roll it out to all users. 
- You must also be capable of disabling the feature if it needs more work. 

Feature flags can enable or disable a feature with a simple toggle. You can also test the feature on your users before you make it available to everyone. Your users will now have access to the feature and add to a better experience. 

## Create Feature Flags

To create feature flags:

1. Navigate to _Product Experiences_ > _Feature Flags_.  The _Feature Flags_ page displays. 
2. Click the **+Feature Flag** button to create a new feature flag. The create a _Feature Flag_ page displays. 
3. Enter the name and description for your feature flag. For example, create an _Auto Playlist Feature Flag_.
4. Select the _Segments_ and _Keys_ for your feature flag. The _keys_ are the keys that you have assigned in your app for each feature and the segments are the group of users who will receive this feature. 

For example, select the "iPhone users in New York" and "iPhone users in Miami" segment.  Select the keys called _Auto Playlist_ key.  For more information on creating keys, refer to [Keys](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/product-config#section-create-keys).

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> A feature flag can have only boolean values, that is, true or false. A key can only be used in one feature flag.

5. Under _Key value and priority_, add the set the key value for each segment. 
6. Toggle the selected segment and define the percent of users who will receive this change.

# Role-Based Access Control for Product Experiences

Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported for _Product Experiences_. If you have advanced RBAC enabled for your account, admins can customize permissions and access roles. There are three standard system roles: _Admin_, _Creator_, and _Member_. 

If you do not have advanced RBAC, the _Admin_ role will have read and write access for all setup (keys, segments, goals and settings), product config, feature flags and A/B tests. _Creator_ will have read and write access to experiences and experiments. Creator will have only read access to setup (keys, segments, and goals), and the _Member_ role will have only read access for product config, feature flag, and A/B tests. Members will also have read access to setup. 

For more information, refer to [Role-Based Access Control](doc:role-based-access-control-2).
